# Bootcamp_Project_1
Bootcamp Project 1, started 18 August, due on 29 August.  You got this!

Currently we are working on an app which will allow users to select a city and view available hikes in that location. In addition, 
they will be able to view the current air quality of that location. This way we hope to allow our users to make conscious healthy choices 
about their outdoor activity. 
Our team consists of four people. We have divided the work into front-end and back-end information.
