**Motivation**

In August 2020 the US passed the _Great American Outdoors Act_, which will secure permanent funding for the Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The LWCF funds, protects and expands trails and public hiking areas across America. According to _AmericanHiking.org_, 1 in every 6 people goes hiking every year, with more joining constantly.

With the increase of hiking popularity and the stable funding of LWCF, we are sure to see a rise in the need for better and more detaild user hiking apps.

As Americans everyday are becoming more environmentally and health aware, we are proud to include an air quality index to allow users to consider pollutant amounts during their hike.

**Notes**

In future versions we hope to add the ability for users to leave and view reviews of their hikes. We'd like to make the app more interactive so users can connect it to their health apps, connect to their friends via the app, view the average time to finish the hike, average calories burned per hike, whether the hike has public facilities and if dogs or bikes are allowed on the path. Our goal is to be a one stop app for users to find all their information for their hikes. 


**_Elevator Speech_**  
The number of hikers in the US has almost doubled from 2005-2020 and with the US having just passed the Great American Outdoors Act, the number will only increase. Trails are getting better funded & expanding. People are becoming more health conscious.

Hikers want an easy one-in-all app where they can get their trail information, weather information and environment information instead of having to open a separate weather app, a separate pollution app and a separate hike app.

Our app allows users to choose what they can choose - length, elevation, difficulty; and be aware of things they canâ€™t - temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality.
